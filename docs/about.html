    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p> Hello, I'm Brady Phillips! I am currently in my final year studying Computer Science at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB).
        Welcome to my personal portfolio website to display my projects, resume and anything else I wish to show the world.
    </p>        

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <hr>
    <p> Ever since I was a kid I always knew that I was in love with technology, and I wanted to do something in life that would allow me to learn more about technology and use it on a day-to-day basis
        So I found Computer Science and I have been hooked since. 
    </p>

    <p> My journey to learn Computer Science starts back in middle school. In middle school, I joined an organization called Technology Student Association (TSA). 
        In TSA I did game design where I got my first introduction to coding, The game was nothing all that crazy.
        It was just a little ping pong game where after you scored you had to answer a question on a random topic like history, math, etc.
        I wish I still had that game but I have lost it, unfortunately. Even so, I was able to get second place for game design at State which was hosted at the University of Alabama.
    </p>

    <p> After middle school, I did some web design in high school, just mainly HTML, not CSS or JS.
        After high school, I went to Coastal Alabama Community College and got my AS in Computer Science.
        At Coastal they did not teach much, they just taught C++ basics and object orientation. 
        My coding world expanded dramatically once I transferred to the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). 
        Since attending UAB I have learned Python, C, CSS, JS, Databases, AWS, GIT, and even Racket!
    </p>

    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <hr>
    <p> As of writing this, I have not had any work experience, internships, or other professional roles, related to Programming, unfortunately. 
        I am actively applying to interests and jobs related to programming to get started getting some work experience in that field.
    </p>

    <p> I have worked for other jobs though, some of which include Receiver/Stocker for Lowe's Home Improvement, Sales Associate for Shoe Station Inc, and a Crew Member for Wendy's. 
        While these jobs are not programming-related they still allowed me to learn how to work in a fast-paced environment and how to work well with others.
    </p>

    <p> With all that being said I have worked on numerous projects for my classes at UAB, some of which were In groups. 
        If you would like to see some of the notable projects I have done be sure to check out the projects tab!
    </p>

    <h2>Skills</h2>

        <li> AWS </li>
    </ul> 

    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <hr>
    <p> Some of my interests/hobbies include cars, volleyball, and gaming. 
        Growing up I watched my dad work on different cars out in his shop, and over time I developed an interest in them. 
        Don't get me wrong though I only know the basics on how to work on them, I just admire how they look and things that people have done to their cars
    </p>

    <p> On top of cars, I have fallen in love with a new hobby, volleyball! Well, beach volleyball to be more exact. 
        A few of my friends introduced me to beach volleyball and I have been hooked ever since. 
        I find myself always looking forward to going to the courts each week and playing for hours.
    </p>

    <p> Another long-time hobby of mine has been gaming. 
        I guess it makes sense for me to be into gaming, with me being in love with technology. 
        I play all sorts of different games and genres. 
        Some of which include, MOBA, MMO, Survival, FPS, and Racing to name a few.
    </p>

    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <hr>
    <p> Some of my goals of mine include getting an internship or full-time job as a software developer, software engineer, or related role, 
        continually learning and experimenting with new languages, frameworks, and tools, 
        and finishing and continually adding to this portfolio so I can showcase my projects, skills, and anything else I wish to share.
